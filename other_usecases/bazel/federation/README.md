## Federation Demo Workspace

This workspace contains a [Federation](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-federation) build.
Federation is a scheme to align the versions of a number of commonly used Bazel rule implementations.

The current state of the Federation repo is 'defunct'.
It is not recommended for actual use.
Look at 'bzlmod' instead.

This demo is currently unable to use the Federation support for protobuf successfully.
There is an [open issue](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-federation/issues/32) for that on Federation.
