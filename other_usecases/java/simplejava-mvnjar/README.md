### Simple Java Workspace with Maven Jar

This workspace uses the obsolete *maven_jar* rule that was built into Bazel to import external dependencies.
*maven_jar* was removed in Bazel version 2.0

DO NOT use this workspace as an example for any ongoing Bazel workspace.
This remains here only as a test case for tools that need to support old versions of Bazel.
